# Test markdeep

## Does this heading work?

#### Extra diag token

Correctly working:
[x] draw lines along connected path(just A to B)
[ ] Handle connections for corners and vertexes
[ ] Handle other shapes being close without overwriting
[ ] Finalize token selection
[x] Fork markdeep
[ ] Migrate changes to legit branch (in new version number)
[ ] Abstract out changes as much as possible for easy merging

Determine an unused character and add to processing for diag lines

The series or line would function similiar to existing diagonal lines but check i-1 and j-i.
Similar to pathfinding for dynamic programming.
